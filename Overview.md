## Package/ Library Overview
#### Which package/library did you select?
I select the pandas package in python to be my topic research for the first exporation activities

1.  What is the package/library?

        What purpose does it serve?

            The pandas library in python is used for analyzing, cleaning, exploring and manipulating data. So it mainly working with data sets. This library will be helpful for student that chosing Data Science as their major.

            The pygame is used to create some game by using images, the program will display multiple image per second on the screen. 

2.  How do you use it?

        You can just simply import the pandas/pygame from the library after install it.

    To install it?

        If you are using Visual Studio Code, open your terminal then simply type in "pip install pandas" . This will install every package you need to use pandas in python

        If you are using Mac, you have to ensure that you have python3 and pip3 up to date. You can check that by using:
        > python3 --version
        > pip3 --version

        If you want to make sure that your pip3 version run perfectlym you can update it by:
        > pip3 install --upgrade pip
    
        To install pandas, type : > "pip3 install pandas" in the terminal. 
        To install pygame, type : > "pip3 install pygame"
    
    Some basic function to use when using pandas

        
        
3.  What are the functionalities of the package?/library?

    a  To analyze the data set from JSON, csv or excel file. 
    b  To make a graph, calculate probability, vv
    c  Mainly for working with data sets

4.  When was it created?

    Pandas was created in January 11 2008
    Pygame was

5.  Why did you select this package/library?

    I choose pandas as my topic research because my major is Data Science, this will be my foundation for me future project as well as improve my knowledge when handling data sets problem.

    I choose the pyagme for the second exploration because around the middle of the term, i found my interest in trying new stuff and i think of working on a simple game.

6.  How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?

    Exporing pandas help me to understand more about python, it was really fun to study this and manipulate data set that i found.

    Learning pygame take more time than expected, but it help a lot when it coming to working with OOP classes.


7.  How was your overall experiences with the package/library?

    From a scale from 1-10, I'm thinking that I'm around 6-7 at the moment, i need more practice as well as some experiences to manipulate/ understand more function

    It was really fun when coding the game, lots of mistake, but i learn more from failing.
